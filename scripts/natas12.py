This one doesn't really work as a python script, mostly because I don't know how to upload files with the requests library.
The idea is that you're asked to submit a jpg file, but in reality you create a PHP file that grabs the password from 
/etc/natas_webpass/natas13, and give it a jpg extension. Then change the filename to a php file in the hidden input field,
then access the file on the server, at which point it compiles and grabs the password.
